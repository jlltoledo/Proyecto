    <section>
        <p>I have a major in visual arts and currently I’m a Java Full Stack Developer in training. I’m very excited to introduce myself into the tech industry in order to face new challenges and grow professionally.

            I’m a person highly driven by curiosity, I seek information until resources are exhausted to later share it with others. I consider myself tidy and responsible, which has helped me gain the trust of my supervisors in different jobs.
            
            Based in Mexico City.</p>
